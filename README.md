# Incomplete-Open-for-contributions
### A list of my projects which are incomplete and are open to contributions
Somtimes , I do not have enough time to complete these projects, say if I have more large projects to work on, so I leave them open to contributions for some beginners wanting to test their skills and practive how to contribute to open source projects. So feel free to contribute. Message [me](https://t.me/bengbp) on telegram incase you have any questions. 


## Steps to Contribute:
- Create an issue about your contribution
  - The issue name should follow this format `[issue title ] for project [project name]`
  - Add some details and if possible some screenshots or images based on your solution
- Then mention me in the issue and ask me to create a repository for that project.
- Since each project has its own git repo, it is recommended to copy only the folder then make your changes and create a pull request against the repository i will create. 
- Wait for me to review your changes.
